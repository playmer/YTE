Steps to set up YTE Model Exporter:

*** Installing the files ***
1. Open a file browser.
2. Navigate to Documents/maya/2017/scripts
4. Move the folder you extracted (YTE_Model_Exporter) into the directory Documents/maya/2017/scripts.
   It should contain 4 files:
   (exportModelAssets.py, materialChecking.py, YTE_Model_Exporter.py, __init__.py)
5. That's it! You're done!
